# Use one keystore for storing all keys/keypairs/certificates

Since keys/certificates for security policies are going to be stored in Winery, we need to consider the possible storage options.
We assume that Winery is run in secure environment.

## Considered Options

* [A] Store keys/certificates as-is
* [B] Use one keystore for all keys/certificates
* [C] Use separate keystores for every stored key/keypair/...

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: [B], because security layer is not present in Winery and multiple keystores do not make storage more secure in this case.   

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### [A] Store keys/certificates as-is

* Good, because it is the simplest option to implement 
* Bad, because keys/keypairs/certificates have to be handled in a separate manner
* Bad, because keys/keypairs/certificates are stored in the file system completely unprotected

### [B] Use one keystore for all keys/certificates

* Good, because all types of keys and certificates can be stored in one password-protected place 
* Bad, because keystore still can be accessed via Winery
* Bad, because it can be difficult to maintain unique aliases for all entities 

### [C] Use separate keystores for every stored key/keypair/...

* Good, because keys for different modelers can be stored in separate protected keystores
* Good, because credentials for keystores can be generated at publishing time and known only to publishers 
* Bad, because it makes key management more difficult
