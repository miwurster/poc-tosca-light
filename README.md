Winery is a Web-based environment to graphically model TOSCA topologies and plans managing these topologies.
It is an Eclipse project and thus support is available through its project page <https://eclipse.org/winery>.
Winery is also part of the OpenTOSCA ecosystem where more information is available at <http://www.opentosca.org>.

The proof of concept implemenation is based on Eclipse Winery.
The modeling tools has been extended to check existing and imported Service Templates for TOSCA Light compliancy.
The first screenshot shows the Service Template view of such a TOSCA Light compliant blueprint.
Winery will flag it to be TOSCA Light compliant by adding a special logo to the top left header.

If a Service Template does not comply with TOSCA Light, Winery has been extended to produce an "error log" as depicted in the screenshot.

**There was no security of Eclipse Winey. There might be [remote code execution vulnerabilities](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec). Thus, when hosting Eclipse Winery, make it accessible to turstworthy parties only.**

Both development and user documentation is rendered at <https://eclipse.github.io/winery/>.

## Running Winery

### Running via Docker

1. `docker build -t winery .`.
   In case, there are issues, you can also try `docker build --no-cache -t winery .`
2. `docker run -p 8080:8080 winery` to run Winery on <http://localhost:8080>

You can also use the pre-built image and bin it to a local repository:

    docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd):/var/opentosca/repository opentosca/winery
