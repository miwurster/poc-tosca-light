Winery is a Web-based environment to graphically model TOSCA topologies and plans managing these topologies.
It is an Eclipse project and thus support is available through its project page <https://eclipse.org/winery>.
Winery is also part of the OpenTOSCA ecosystem where more information is available at <http://www.opentosca.org>.

**The code and the linked libraries are NOT approved by Eclipse Legal.**

**There was no security of Eclipse Winey. There might be [remote code execution vulnerabilities](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec). Thus, when hosting Eclipse Winery, make it accessible to turstworthy parties only.**

Both development and user documentation is rendered at <https://eclipse.github.io/winery/>.
The source for the documentation can be found at [docs/](docs).

## Running Winery

### Running via Docker

1. `docker build -t winery .`.
   In case, there are issues, you can also try `docker build --no-cache -t winery .`
2. `docker run -p 8080:8080 winery` to run Winery on <http://localhost:8080>

You can also use the pre-built image and bin it to a local repository:

    docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd):/var/opentosca/repository opentosca/winery

### Running Winery CLI via Docker

1. `docker build -t winery-cli -f Dockerfile.cli .`
2. `docker run -v $(pwd):/root/winery-repository -it winery-cli` to check `${pwd}` for consistency.

You can also use the pre-built image:

- Linux: `docker run -it -v $(pwd):/root/winery-repository opentosca/winery-cli`
- Windows: `docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/root/winery-repository opentosca/winery-cli`

In case you want to have verbose information, you can execute following:

- Linux: `docker run -it -v $(pwd):/root/winery-repository opentosca/winery-cli winery -v`
- Windows: `docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/root/winery-repository opentosca/winery-cli winery -v`

Currently supported CLI arguments:

```
usage: winery
 -h,--help         prints this help
 -p,--path <arg>   use given path as repository path
 -v,--verbose      be verbose: Output the checked elements
```

## Next steps

Winery currently is far from being a production ready modeling tool.
The next steps are:

* Add more usability features to the topology modeler
* Add support for multiple repositories
* Develop a plugin-system for user-defined editors. For instance, a constraint has a type. If a type is known to Winery, it can present a specific plugin to edit the type content instead of a generic XML editor.
* Add a real DAO layer to enable querying the available TOSCA contents using SQL or similar query language

## Known issues

* XSD Type declarations are not directly supported
** Declared types are converted to imports during a CSAR Import
** Editing of XSDs is not possible
* **The XSD of OASIS TOSCA v1.0 has been modified** - see https://github.com/eclipse/winery/issues/71
  * An Implementation Artifact may carry a `name` attribute
  * The contents of properties of Boundary Definitions are processed in `lax` mode
  * New elements have been added:
    * Pattern Refinement Models
    * Compliance Rules
* See https://github.com/eclipse/winery/issues
